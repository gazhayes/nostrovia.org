The podcast that tells you everything you need to know about Nostr this week.

All the new projects, all the new cool stuff, all the new NIPs, it's all here. Once a week. Listen to it.

[Create an issue](https://github.com/gazhayes/nostrovia.org/issues/new) if you want me to talk about your project. The podcast will be released every Wednesday.
